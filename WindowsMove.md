When moving to Windows

Copy the .ps1 file to the Windows machine.

Update all paths (C:\MasterPrintFolder, FolderMill hot folders, etc.) if needed.

Make sure PowerShell execution policy is set on Windows (Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned).

Test the script there â€” everything should work exactly the same.
